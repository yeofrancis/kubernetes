# Docker Swarm (notes)

- Built-in orchestrator (older than K8s), simple to start
- Concepts: **node** (manager/worker), **service**, **task**, **stack**
- Pros: easy, native to Docker; Cons: less ecosystem than Kubernetes
- Good stepping stone to understand orchestration (replicas, rolling updates)
